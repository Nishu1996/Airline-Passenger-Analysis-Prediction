# Airline-Passenger-Analysis-Prediction
Forecasting passenger satisfaction in the airline industry
The "Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction" project focuses on gaining insights and predicting passenger satisfaction within the airline industry. Understanding the pivotal role of passenger contentment in shaping brand perception and financial success, this initiative employs data analytics to make well-informed predictions. The project comprises four primary phases: Introduction, Discovery and Data Preparation, Model Planning and Building.

# Data Source: 
Kaggle
# Data Cleaning Phase: 
Various techniques, such as data summarization, handling missing values, outlier removal, and correlation analysis, were applied. 
# Model Panning and Building Phase: 
The Model Planning and Building phase involved the selection of appropriate models for the binary classification task of predicting passenger satisfaction. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes models were chosen, each offering unique advantages.
# Conclusion and Observation: 
Results and Performance evaluation demonstrated that logistic regression outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and area under the curve (AUC).
